**Project Description - "React-TS-Web-App":**

This project is the result of my commitment to deepen my knowledge in web application development, specifically focusing on the usage of React and TypeScript. Throughout the development process, I actively practiced my skills in TypeScript and solidified my understanding of React.

A key aspect of the application is the incorporation of the Axios library for handling HTTP requests, allowing efficient interaction with the server and dynamic data loading. Additionally, for styling the interface, I integrated the Tailwind CSS library, providing flexibility and style to the application.

The project encompasses the functionality of React Router DOM, ensuring smooth navigation between pages. In particular, I created the ability to view products, similar to a marketplace, and implemented transitions between pages to enhance the overall user experience.

However, a significant milestone was reached in working with the database, where I first mastered the processes of interacting with data on the website. This added a level of complexity and interest to my project, as well as a better understanding of how data is managed and transmitted in the application.

Ultimately, React-TS-Web-App not only served as a platform for practice and reinforcement of knowledge but also became a showcase of skills, bringing together React, TypeScript, and database interaction.
